ClassGraphR
-----------

Produce class dependency graphs by tracing method calls while code runs. Outputs
a .dot file for use with GraphViz.

Requirements
-----------
Ruby 1.9 or later & Graphviz on your $PATH

Usage
-----
Require 'classgraphr' and call trace_class_dependencies, passing in a block
containing the code you want to graph. A Hash of sets will be returned, ready
for proccesing with make_class_graph. Calling make_class_graph uses the `dot`
command to generate a graph & save it to /tmp/graph.png.
